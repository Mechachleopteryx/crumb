<h1>IncrementalExtensionType</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">IncrementalExtensionType</span></code>
<p>Indicates to an annotation processor environment supporting incremental annotation processing
(currently a feature specific to Gradle starting with version 4.8) the incremental type of an
Extension.</p>
<p>The constants for this enum are ordered by increasing performance (but also constraints).</p>
<h3>Enum Values</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-u-n-k-n-o-w-n.html">UNKNOWN</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The incrementality of this extension is unknown, or it is neither aggregating nor isolating.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-a-g-g-r-e-g-a-t-i-n-g.html">AGGREGATING</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This extension is <em>aggregating</em>, meaning that it may generate outputs based on several
annotated input classes and it respects the constraints imposed on aggregating processors.
It is common for Crumb producer extensions to be aggregating and unusual for consumer
extensions to be aggregating.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-i-s-o-l-a-t-i-n-g.html">ISOLATING</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This extension is <em>isolating</em>, meaning roughly that its output depends on the
<code>@CrumbConsumer</code>/<code>@CrumbProducer</code> class and its dependencies, but not on other <code>@CrumbConsumer</code>/<code>@CrumbProducer</code>
classes that might be compiled at the same time. The constraints that an isolating extension must
respect are the same as those that Gradle imposes on an isolating annotation processor.
It is unusual for Crumb producer extensions to be isolating and common for consumer
extensions to be isolating.</p>
